                <h2>Our story: More than just a coffee</h2>
                <p>What started as a way to make someone's day turned into a full coffee experience.</p>
                <p>Beginning with a simple game of guessing the color inside my coffee mug. I quickly noticed that it
                    felt
                    like there was a little extra caffeine in my coffee on days that I guessed right.</p>
                <p>Now, our coffee shop brings this fun experience to life, offering moments of connection and
                    excitement
                    with every cup.</p>

                <h2>Our mission</h2>
                <p>To deliver an experience that makes people's day.</p>
                <p>Through playfulness, extreme hospitality, and consistent quality, we turn everyday routines into
                    moments
                    worth smiling about.</p>
                <p>At Morning Mugs, we don't just serve coffee—we serve a moment. Our mission is to make people's day
                    through
                    playful energy, unreasonably good hospitality, and a commitment to doing things well every single
                    time.</p>
                <p>Whether it's the Color Guessing Game, a quick laugh at the register, or taking a selfie with the
                    famous
                    Banana Bread Latte, we believe the little things can turn a routine into something meaningful. We're
                    here
                    to create those moments. Consistently. Intentionally. With heart.</p>
