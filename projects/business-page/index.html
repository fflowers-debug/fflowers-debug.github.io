        <h2>Our story: More than just a coffee</h2>
        <p>What started as a way to make someones day turned into a full coffee experience.

            Beginning with a simple game of guessing the color inside my coffee mug. I quickly noticed that it felt
            like there was a little extra caffeine in my coffee on days that I guessed right."

            Now, our coffee shop brings this fun experience to life, offering moments of connection and excitement
            with every cup.</p>
