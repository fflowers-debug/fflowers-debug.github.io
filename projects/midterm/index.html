    <p class="lead">We asked thousands of people whether they recognized hit songs from the 90s, such as
        <span class="blue">“Wannabe”</span> and <span class="pink">“No
            Scrubs”</span>, ordering the results by birth year.
    </p>

    <img src="./images/01-noscrubs-wannabe.png" alt="no scrubs" />

    <p class="question">Which song is more likely to be recognized by future generations?</p>
    <h1>Defining the 90s Music Canon</h1>
    <p class="author"> Story by Matt Daniels, Data+Code by Ilia Blinderman, <em>Published: July 2020</em> </p>

    <p class="start">Measuring musics popularity has always been contained to a certain period of time: peak chart
        ranking, awards,
        opening-week sales—a songs performance at its prime.</p>

    <p>But for me, its equally important to quantify how music is passed down from generation to generation, parent to
        teen. In 2020, were amid that critical juncture for 90s music—we can finally start asking todays teens, “What
        music do you recognize from the 90s?”</p>

    <p>The answer will indicate how future generations will characterize the decade. I always believed <b>“No
            Diggity”</b> by Blackstreet would be a 90s standard, uniting the old and young crowds at weddings of the
        2050s. And to test this belief, I used 3 million data points that I collected via a <a
            href="https://pudding.cool/2020/04/music-challenge/" target="_blank">music quiz</a>, which asked readers if
        they recognized thousands of songs that charted on the Billboard Hot 100. </p>

    <p class="chart-hed">Millennials know <span class="diggity">“No Diggity.”</span> But Gen Z? Maybe half of them, at
        best.</p>

    <p class="only"></p>

    <p class="pink">Percent of people who recognize a clip of “No Diggity,” by birth year</p>

    <img src="./images/02-nodiggity.png" alt="no diggity" />

    <p class="sinatra">Sinatra, Elvis, and Chuck Berry are emblematic of 50s music, but whats the 90s equivalent? Using
        the recognition
        data we collected, we can begin to define the canon. These will be the artists and songs that Gen Z and beyond
        seem to recognize (and value) among all the musical output from the decade.</p>

    <p>First, its important to understand the general trends in the data. <b>“No Diggity”</b> knowledge peaks among
        people born in 1983, who were 13 years old when the track debuted in 1996. We also see a slow drop off among
        people who were not fully sentient when <b>“No Diggity”</b> was in its prime, individuals who were 5 years old
        or younger (or not born yet) in 1996.</p>

    <p>That drop-off rate between generations—in this case, Millennials to Gen Z—is one indicator for whether <b>“No
            Diggity”</b> is surviving the test of time. </p>

    <p>To make this a bit easier to read, well chart a persons age at the time of a songs release, rather than birth
        year. For songs to be passed to down, generation to generation, wed expect a slower decay rate—evidence that
        theyre part of the <a
            href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/the-universal-decay-of-collective-memory-and-attention/"
            target="_blank">collective memory.</a></p>
    <p>Lets look at another example from the mid-nineties: <b>“The
            Sign”</b> by Ace of Base.</p>

    <p class="chart-hed">Similar to <b>“No Diggity,”</b> notice the decline in knowledge of <span>“The Sign”</span>
        among people who were 5 years old when it was released in 1993.</p>

    <p class="only"></p>

    <p class="pink">Recognition of <b>“The Sign”</b> by age in 1993, the year it debuted</p>

    <img src="./images/03-thesign.png" alt="the sign" />

    <p class="only">Only half of readers currently in their teens recognized “The
        Sign.” The trend here is that music has a natural half-life. Find
        someone 10 to 15 years your junior, and the likelihood that theyll
        know your childhood music references is lower than you think.</p>
    <p>How much lower?</p>

    <p>Song knowledge erodes with each passing year. This is why I shouldnt be shocked that my Gen Z colleague has never
        heard <b class="pink">“The Sign,”</b> or that teens are filming themselves listening to <b>“Bohemian
            Rhapsody”</b> for the
        first time. This is a normal part of the aging process for music.</p>

    <p>If you take any present-day hit thats culturally pervasive, such as <b>“Old Town Road”</b> or <b>“Despacito,”</b>
        wed expect that someone born today, in 2020, will probably not recognize it twenty years from now. In short,
        theres a good chance theyll interpret your karaoking of Lizzo, Drake, or the Jonas Brothers in 2040 as an
        obscure act.</p>

    <p>There are some especially sobering examples of this decay.</p>

    <p class="chart-hed">The 1999 hit “Wild Wild West” by Will Smith has lower-than-expected recognition among Gen Z.
        <span class="blue">These songs</span> are fading at an accelerated rate.

        </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="only">In 1999, <b>“Wild Wild West”</b> was the song of the summer. Yet it is fading far faster than any
        other 90s hit
        with comparable starting popularity. Twenty years ago, it was inescapable. Maybe Millennials are still too sick
        of it, even for nostalgia rotation. Perhaps it wasnt even that great of a song to begin with, artificially
        inflated by Smiths celebrity and cross-promotion with the film Wild Wild West.</p>

    <p><b>“Quit Playing Games”</b> is the Backstreet Boys fastest-decaying hit (<b>“Everybody”</b> is the opposite,
        known by 97% of Millennials and 86% of Gen Z). Im not sure where a love ballad like <b>“Quit Playing Games”</b>
        fits in 2020, but I was definitely surprised by how few Gen Zers know it. Same thing for J.Los <b>“If You Had My
            Love,”</b> though there are far better songs from her oeuvre—she didnt even perform it at the Super Bowl.
    </p>

    <p>Other songs, meanwhile, remain unusually resilient and have higher-than-expected universal recognition. </p>

    <p class="chart-hed">These are <span class="green">candidate songs for the 90s canon</span> and have yet to fade
        from culture.</p>

        </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="only">Why have these songs transcended generations? Theres no unifying theory. <b>“Jump Around”</b> still
        gets airplay
        during timeouts at sporting events. <b>“Macarena”</b> is still a bar mitzvah mainstay.<b>“I Will Always Love
            You”</b> is Whitney Houstons magnum opus (or perhaps its Dolly Partons resurgence). While there are
        countless reasons for a song to stay culturally relevant, its staying power is not merely a function of its
        popularity in the year of release.</p>

    <p>Theres another fascinating cut of this data: songs that are generational markers, which are approaching zero
        recognition by Gen Z.</p>

    <p class="chart-hed">K-Ci and JoJos <span class="orange">“All My Life”</span> and Jewels <span class="orange">“You

    <p class="only">It seems sacreligious to think that future generations will not know the significance of <b>“All My
            Life”.</b>
        Its disconcerting to think that the markers of my childhood, what was culturally ubiquitous, will, in a couple
        of decades, be lost to time. There will be a moment when I can, incredibly, play it for someone and theyll hear
        it for the first time.</p>

    <p>Maybe theyll think its “good music.” That does seem to be the story of every generation: my parents went through
        the same existential shock when my knowledge of the 70s was spottier than they expected. </p>

    <p>Every parent makes a mental note of music theyll pass down to their children—records that they hope will shape
        their childrens taste and barometer for quality. That process is a marvelous filtering mechanism, a value
        judgement of what should be cherished versus what just happened to be popular. Billboard #1 hits mean nothing if
        future parents dont tell their children, “This is good music.”</p>

    <p>When records are not replayed, they become fleeting fads in the eyes of history. In the case of <b>“Wild Wild
            West,”</b> the only people who understood its importance were those who were there in 1999, at peak Will
        Smith. </p>

    <p>But, some songs will survive—the ones most recognized by Gen Z.</p>
